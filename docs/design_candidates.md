## BOX 1 - Shift register box

The user is presented with 4 LEDs and 4 switches. Switches seemingly correspond to the LEDs above them, however, depending on the level, one switch enables a software shift register. The task for the user would be to inspect the box for shift registers and find which ‘bits’ are shift registers and how they influence the LEDs. Depending on the level there are 1, 2 or 3 shift registers all influencing a 4-bit box.

First level has one bit shifted, second has two and third has three.

This box helps identify linkage between elements.

## BOX 2 - Salience bias box

The user is presented with a box with seemingly random number of buttons and elements. One element is a button that is heart shaped, one is labeled with a skull and bones icon, and others are of different shapes and colors. Some elements will produce side-effects like sound, other will do nothing.

The task for the user would be to test the salience effect premise - will the user assign more values to buttons that look “more important” like the kill button, buttons that are larger, buttons that produce side-effects like sound, or those who do absolutely nothing. Another possible route for user experiments is to test users conviction that the button importance is valid even if no side-effects are produced.



## BOX 3 - Pseudocertainty / Peltzman effect box (PRC machine)

The user is presented with a box containing 7 RGB LEDs and three buttons all corresponding to a color (a button labeled RED, GREEN, and BLUE). The box offers three levels of gameplay. The goal of the user is to guess which color will light up next. The user will be required to press a button corresponding to the color he/she thinks will light up next in the sequence. Upon pressing a button the next LED in the sequence will light up, if the user input was correct it will signal for the next input, however, if the input is wrong it will reset the game. There is not succession through levels, the goal is for the user to acquire a sense of pattern and describe it, which might lead to pseudo-certainty.

On the first level, the game will present a recurring pattern of using only two colors and always map in 3+4 pattern. (RRRGGGG, GGGRRRR, …)

On the second level, the game will use all three colors for the sequence and present the user with a mixed 2-3-2, 2-2-3, 3-2-2 pattern.

On the third level the sequence will be entirely random using all three colors.

## BOX 4 - Bandwagon effect boxes (two similar looking boxes operating differently)

The user is presented with two boxes, seemingly same in design.

The first box has one button, two switches, 2 LEDs, 3 7-segment display and one slider. The second box also has a speaker hidden inside of the construction. 

The first box implements a infinite positive counter, the slider will increase the speed of ticks on the counter. The second box doesn’t implement a counter, instead it shows 000 upon boot and the slider increments from 000 to 999 on sliding. 

On both boxes a switch will turn on an LED. On one box a single button will play a sound, while on the other it will have no functionality assigned to it.

On the first box an LED will light up after 666. On the other box a switch will turn on the LED, while the counter will have no effect on the LED.

The goal for a user experiment is for the user to map out differences in the system and to recognize the bandwagon effect. This will prove useful in testing because no preexisting assumptions about a system will be made of a system based on the appearance of the system when not under load.

## BOX 6 - Linkage bias box (box with elements seemingly linked)

The box presents a user with an erratic interface, in the top left corner there is a 2 digit display with a button under it. In the bottom right corner there is a set of two buttons and a digital potentiometer/rotary encoder. On the far right there is a single LED, and in the middle of the box there is an array of 3 LEDs. The goal of this box is to prove a linkage bias, if the user is asked to power on a single LED, which button will they choose? How do you start and stop the timer on the 2 digit display? This will go to show users that linkage although desirable in UX is not always a given when testing unknown systems.
